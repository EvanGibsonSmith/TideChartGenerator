This is a tide chart generator for the Bar Island Trail in Acadia National Park, in Bar Harbor, Maine. It automatically generates a calendar for the given month, or a future month if specified.

To use, download the exe file GUI.exe from the dist folder (a Windows operating system is required) and place it into a folder where you wish to keep the calendar form of the tide charts.
Then, double clicking the exe file will load a small application that can generate these tide charts within that folder.
